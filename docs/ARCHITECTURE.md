# Architecture

How a screen flows through the system, and where the "not a clone" analytics
live. See `AGENTS.md` for the rules and `docs/MCP.md` for the MCP surface.

## The shape

                 | backend/analytics |  computed columns, stats, factor model
                 +-------------------+
```

The key idea: **one pipeline, two front doors.** Both the HTTP endpoint
(`app.py`) and the MCP `screen` tool (`mcp_server.py`) call
`pipeline.run_screen`, so a screen produces identical results no matter who
drives it. `app.py` adds only an HTTP-level TTL cache around it; the MCP server
adds its own small cache. Neither reimplements the pipeline.

## A screen, step by step

1. **Request.** A `ScreenRequest` (`backend/models.py`): market, filters,
   columns, match (all/any), computed columns, stats, factor weights, sort,
   limit, offset.
2. **Column planning** (`pipeline._query_columns`). The query needs not just the
   requested columns but any base fields the stats, factor, and sort steps will
   read. Those are unioned in so a `zscore(change)` stat or a factor on
   `Perf.1M` has its source column present.
3. **Query** (`screener.run_query`). Builds a `tradingview_screener.Query` scoped
   to the market via the per-market helper (stocks/crypto/forex/...), translates
   each `{field, op, value}` into a column condition (`_apply_op`), applies the
   server-side sort and the offset/limit, and runs it. Every upstream call is
   wrapped so a failure becomes a clean `ScreenerError`, never a 500 stacktrace.
4. **Analytics** (`backend/analytics.py`), over the returned rows:
   - **Computed columns:** a sandboxed AST evaluator (`safe_eval`). Operators
     `+ - * / % **` and functions `abs min max round sqrt log ln floor ceil`.
     It rejects attribute access, subscripts, names with `__`, strings, and any
     call to a non-whitelisted function. A bad expression yields `None`, not an
     exception.
   - **Stats:** `zscore`, `pctrank`, `rank`, `norm`, each computed across the
     returned set (not the whole universe), emitted as a `fn(field)` column.
   - **Factor:** a direction-aware weighted z-score blend. Each field is
     z-scored across the rows, negated when `dir == "low"`, scaled by weight, and
     summed into `factor_score`. Missing values contribute zero.
5. **Shape.** Floats are rounded and NaN/inf become null. The column order is
   query columns, then computed, then stats, then `factor_score`.

## Fields

`backend/fields.py` holds a curated, grouped, typed catalog (~190 friendly
fields) layered over the full TradingView field universe (1000+), loaded from
`fields_all.json` (generated offline by `gen_fields.py`, no runtime network
call). `validate_field` accepts any catalog field and any catalog field carrying
a known timeframe suffix (`RSI|1W`, `close|240`). This is why timeframe-suffixed
columns work everywhere, including the MCP `analyze` tool's multi-timeframe read.

## The MCP layer

`backend/mcp_server.py` wraps the same engine. Discovery and screening tools call
`run_screen`; the symbol-intelligence tools (`analyze`, `technical_rating`,
`chart`, ...) resolve a row via `_resolve_row` and compose TradingView's own
fields into structured reads. The `analyze` tool pulls RSI and MACD on every
timeframe in one query and reports alignment. See `docs/MCP.md`.

## Frontend

Vanilla ES modules, no build step. Each feature module calls
`window.Screener.registerModule(name, ctx => {...})` and receives a context with
the store, the API client, and an element accessor. State lives in a small store
(`frontend/js/state.js`); formatting in `frontend/js/format.js`; the look is
entirely driven by the tokens in `frontend/css/theme.css`. A market switch resets
filters/factor/computed/stats so carried-over conditions cannot empty a new
market.

## Caching and resilience

A small in-memory TTL cache (`backend/cache.py`) keyed by a hash of the request
sits in front of the engine in both front doors. It also softens TradingView's
rate-limit behavior under bursty agent use. The MCP `server_stats` tool reports
the cache hit rate and error count.
