# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents and human contributors working in this repo. This is the
canonical project guide. `CLAUDE.md` points here.

## What this is

NEON SCREENER is a live, real-data market screener with a quant analytics layer,
plus an MCP server so an AI agent can drive it. It is a showcase of what you can
build on TradingView: the screener app you run at home, a static widget showcase
for GitHub Pages, and an MCP layer that makes the whole thing AI-drivable.

Two halves:
- **The app** (`backend/` + `frontend/`): the full screener. FastAPI backend over
  the `tradingview-screener` package, vanilla-JS frontend, no build step.
- **The showcase** (`showcase/`): a static, no-backend site (TradingView widgets +
  Lightweight Charts) that deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Hard rules (do not break)

1. **No em dashes anywhere.** Not in code, comments, UI copy, docs, or commit
   messages. Use periods, commas, or "and". This is enforced across the repo.
2. **TradingView only.** No Tradier, Yahoo, Finviz, brokers, or any other data
   source or destination. Every byte of data and every handoff is TradingView.
   This is the whole point of the project.
3. **Read-only.** No order execution, no money movement, no brokerage. The
   "Open in TradingView" link is a navigation, not a trade.
4. **No build step on the frontend.** Vanilla ES modules, hand-rolled CSS. Do
   not add a bundler, framework, or transpiler.
5. **Every field id must be real.** Catalog and preset fields are validated
   against the live TradingView field universe. A typo that returns nothing is a
   bug. See `backend/fields.py` and the preset tests.

## Layout

```
backend/        FastAPI app + the screen engine
  app.py          HTTP routes, static mount, TTL cache wrapper
  pipeline.py     run_screen(): the shared screen pipeline (HTTP and MCP both call it)
  screener.py     thin wrapper over tradingview-screener (Query building, operators)
  analytics.py    sandboxed AST expression engine, stats (zscore/pctrank/rank/norm), factor model
  fields.py       the field catalog (curated + full universe), validation, defaults
  presets.py      47 preset scans + 5 factor presets
  models.py       pydantic request/response models
  cache.py        in-memory TTL cache
  mcp_server.py   the MCP server (fastmcp): 16 tools, 4 prompts, 3 resources
frontend/       vanilla JS, ES modules registering via window.Screener.registerModule
  css/theme.css   the synthwave design tokens (the source of truth for the look)
  js/             feature modules (filters, columns, presets, factor, table, detail, openin, ...)
showcase/       static GitHub Pages site (widget gallery + Lightweight Charts)
pine/           Pine Script meant for AI to read (neon_ai_read.pine)
docs/           screenshots + capture scripts + ARCHITECTURE.md + MCP.md
tests/          pytest (analytics math, MCP wiring, live API smoke)
run.py          launches the web app on 127.0.0.1:8000
run_mcp.py      launches the MCP server (stdio, or --http PORT)
```

## Run it

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py        # web app at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
python run_mcp.py    # MCP server over stdio (--http 8765 for streamable-http)
```

## Test it

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q -m "not live"   # offline: analytics + MCP wiring (fast, no network)
python -m pytest tests/ -q                  # add the live tests (hits TradingView)
node --test frontend/js/store.test.mjs frontend/js/openin.test.mjs   # frontend logic
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the offline suite on every push. Live tests
are skipped in CI on purpose so the build is deterministic.

## Architecture in one paragraph

A screen request (market, filters, columns, computed columns, stats, factor,
sort) flows through `pipeline.run_screen`: it builds the column set, runs the
query via `screener.run_query`, then applies the analytics layer (`analytics`)
over the returned rows. The HTTP endpoint and the MCP `screen` tool both call
`run_screen`, so a screen behaves identically no matter who drives it. See
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full walk-through.

## The MCP server

`backend/mcp_server.py` exposes the same engine over the Model Context Protocol
with `fastmcp`. 16 tools (screening + symbol intelligence), 4 prompts, 3
resources. The centerpiece is `analyze`, a multi-timeframe chart read (RSI and
MACD bias on the 1h/4h/1d/1w/1m at once). Full reference and config in
`docs/MCP.md`.

Register it (Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`, or a project
`.mcp.json` for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neon-screener": {
      "command": "/abs/path/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/abs/path/run_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How to extend (common tasks)

- **Add a preset scan:** append to `PRESETS` in `backend/presets.py` using real
  field ids and the op strings from `backend/screener._apply_op`. The preset
  tests will fail if any field is unknown.
- **Add a field to the catalog:** add a `_f(...)` entry in the right group in
  `backend/fields.py`. Probe it live first so it actually returns data.
- **Add an MCP tool:** add a `@mcp.tool` function in `backend/mcp_server.py` that
  builds a `ScreenRequest` and calls `_run`, or composes the helpers. Add a test
  in `tests/test_mcp.py` (offline for wiring, `@pytest.mark.live` for data).
- **Add a frontend feature:** a new ES module in `frontend/js/` that calls
  `window.Screener.registerModule(name, ctx => {...})`. Use `theme.css` tokens.

## Conventions

- Python: type hints, `from __future__ import annotations`, clean errors (never a
  raw 500 stacktrace; wrap upstream calls in `ScreenerError`).
- Frontend: one feature per module, register through `window.Screener`, style with
  the theme tokens, no inline magic numbers for color.
- Work ships in numbered "waves"; `STATUS.md` is the running log. Update it.
- Commit messages: imperative, no em dashes, end with the Co-Authored-By trailer.
